# Acea-Smart-Water-Analytics-challenge
For this tutorial, we will build a model to predict the depth to groundwater of an aquifer located in Petrignano, Italy. The question we want to answer is What is the future depth to groundwater of a well belonging to the aquifier in Petrigrano over the next quarter? The wells field of the alluvial plain between Ospedalicchio di Bastia Umbra and Petrignano is fed by three underground aquifers separated by low permeability septa. The aquifer can be considered a water table groundwater and is also fed by the Chiascio river. The groundwater levels are influenced by the following parameters: rainfall, depth to groundwater, temperatures and drainage volumes, level of the Chiascio river. Indeed, both rainfall and temperature affect features like level, flow, depth to groundwater and hydrometry some time after it fell down.
